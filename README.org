* Organization

- proto contains the shared protocol code, both DTOs (in the form of Scala case classes), and decoders/encoders
- server contains the game server
- client contains the GUI client

* Running

To start the client, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ./sbt client/run
#+END_SRC

To start the server, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ./sbt "server/run <port>"
#+END_SRC

If you're on Windows, install SBT from [[https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html]], and run sbt instead of ./sbt.
